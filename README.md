In the fall of 2023, I took CISC 375, a Web Development course. We 
started by diving deep into the essentials of webpage creation. We 
learned that HTML is used to structure content for display in web 
browsers, while CSS handles the styling. To apply these skills, we were 
tasked with building our own personal websites, aiming to get hands-on 
experience with both HTML and CSS.

I began my project with an index page to introduce myself. I then added a 
navigation bar at the top with links to different sections: 'resume.
html', 'projects.html', and 'fun.html'. The assignment was flexible, 
allowing us to personalize the design and content. I used CSS to add various design elements such as images, custom text styles, and color themes. You can visit the website by entering 'harn7606.github.io' in your browser's address bar.
